# README

This is the repositofy for the Jalasoft Fullstack Bootcamp. I'm Rafael de Paula, and here you can see my codebase.

To run locally, you will need to install Ruby, Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL in your machine.

### After installed:

- Clone the repo;
- Create the database with `rails db:create`;
- Run the migrations with `rails db:migrate`;
- Run the app with `bin/dev`.
